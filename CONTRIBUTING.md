### üòä Commit convention

`dynamic-styles` is a monorepo, and it is important to write correct and understandable commit messages
to keep the git history clean. All commits made in this repository are divided into **3 groups**:
- `package commits` related to a particular package (e.g. `react` package, `native` package, ..)
- `docs commits` related to any kind of documentation (e.g. README, documentation website, ..)
- `core commits` only related to repository tooling and not associated with any package (e.g. script, config), ..

Commit message consists of **2 parts**:
1. `[area]` - To which area the commit message refers.
2. `message` - Message describing the changes you made.

```text
